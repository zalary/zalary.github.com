    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made it through <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-flavored-ruby#top">Chapter4</a> of the Rails Tutorial tonight.  Everything was pretty nice until the last example in the last exercise didn&#8217;t execure the way it should.</p>

<p>It took a little banging my head into the wall until I remembered something mentioned earlier, and realized I was somehow running 1.8.7 and not 1.9.3 like I thought. So first I went and looked back at how to make the code work in 1.8.7 and &#8216;finished&#8217; the exercise.</p>

<p>Then I decided figure out why rbenv was supposedly installed but  wasn&#8217;t doing what I expected.   There was a little flailing, ut I googled some and poked some and finally got it figured it out.</p>

<p>The lessons I learn sometimes are not the ones I expect, but they keep me moving forward.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While getting back into code, I am also getting into vim. When I used it previously, I pretty much knew &#8216;i&#8217;, which just leads to a lot of frustration.  This time, since I&#8217;m coding mostly via ssh to my ubunu vm, I&#8217;m much more reliant on the terminal for navigating and coding, so I&#8217;m taking the time to learn the myriad of keyboard commands that make vim rock.</p>

<p>And now that I&#8217;ve installed pathogen and figured out where to put/adjust things, I can piddle even more!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just scratching the surface at this point, but even so, I can see how it&#8217;s a total game-changer.</p>
